# Webhooks

A webhook is an endpoint on your server that receives requests from Filmmakers, notifying you about events for actor profiles, such as a profile edit. This requires a new endpoint on your server, such as https://www.example.com/webhooks/filmmakers, which should be publicly accessible and allow unauthenticated POST requests. Note that HTTPS URLs are required for all webhook endpoints.

**Read the Event Data**

Filmmakers sends the event data in the request body. Each event is structured as an Event object with a type, timestamp, and related Filmmakers resource nested under `data` (currently only an actor profile ID â€“ see example below):

```json
{
  "type": "actor_profile.updated",
  "created": 1633887337,
  "data": {
    "id": 123
  }
}
```

There are currently two event types: `actor_profile.updated` and `actor_profile.deleted`. Note that update events are grouped if they occur within a reasonable timeframe; for example, you might only receive one webhook if an actor profile is updated several times within a short timeframe.

**Return a 200 Response**

Send a successful 200 response to Filmmakers as quickly as possible because the event is retried with exponential backoff if a response isn't sent within a reasonable time. This means that you should write any long-running processes as code that can run asynchronously outside the webhook endpoint.

**Verify Requests Are Sent by Filmmakers**

```
X-Signature: t=1492774577, v1=5257a869e7ecebeda32affa62cdca3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff536d0ce8e108d8bd
```

All webhook events are signed by including a signature in each event's header. This allows you to verify that the events were sent by Filmmakers, not by a third party. The API key is used as the secret to sign webhook events. Signatures are generated using a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) with SHA-256.

The `X-Signature` header included in each signed event contains a timestamp and one signature. The timestamp is prefixed by `t=`, and the signature is prefixed by a scheme. Schemes start with `v`, followed by an integer. Currently, the only signature scheme is `v1`.

You can verify the signature on your side as follows:

<Tabs groupId="webhook-examples">
  <TabItem value="ruby" label="Ruby" default>
    ```ruby
    # Step 1: Extract the timestamp and signatures from the header
    signature = request.headers["X-Signature"]
      .split(",")
      .map { |part| part.split("=") }
      .to_h
    # (this returns a hash like { "t" => 1492774577, "v1" => "5257a86..." })

    # Step 2: Prepare the signed_payload string
    payload = request.body.read
    signed_payload = "#{signature['t']}.#{payload}"

    # Step 3: Determine the expected signature
    expected_signature = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(
      OpenSSL::Digest.new("sha256"),
      "YOUR_FILMMAKERS_API_KEY",
      signed_payload
    )

    # Step 4: Compare the signatures
    expected_signature == signature["v1"]
    ```

  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript (Node.js)">
    ```javascript
    const crypto = require('crypto');

    // Step 1: Extract the timestamp and signatures from the header
    const signature = request.headers['x-signature'];
    const elements = signature.split(',');
    const signatureData = {};
    elements.forEach(element => {
      const [key, value] = element.split('=');
      signatureData[key] = value;
    });
    // (this returns an object like { "t": 1492774577, "v1": "5257a86..." })

    // Step 2: Prepare the signed_payload string
    const payload = request.body; // assuming raw body
    const signedPayload = `${signatureData.t}.${payload}`;

    // Step 3: Determine the expected signature
    const expectedSignature = crypto
      .createHmac('sha256', 'YOUR_FILMMAKERS_API_KEY')
      .update(signedPayload)
      .digest('hex');

    // Step 4: Compare the signatures
    const isValid = expectedSignature === signatureData.v1;
    ```

    foreach ($elements as $element) {
