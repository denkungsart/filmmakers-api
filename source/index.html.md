# Introduction

Filmmakers provides a RESTful JSON API with OAuth and token-based authentication. You can request an API key with [our support](https://www.filmmakers.eu/contact/new). The permission scope of the API key varies depending on the use case, so when contacting us be sure to specify the desired use case (e.g. you plan on using Filmmakers data for a website).

# API updates and backwards compatibility

While we won't be introducing any major changes, we do plan to add new features and endpoints over time. Below is a list of changes that we consider backwards compatible:

* Adding new fields or links to responses
* Adding new resources or endpoints
* Adding of new (optional) query parameters
* Changing the default page length for paginated resources
* Modifying the attributes of individual fields (including adding, removing, or modifying values). Updated lists can be retrieved via the attributes endpoint (see dedicated section)
* Updating translations for individual attributes or skill levels

Please bear this in mind when programming against our API, and try to ensure that these non-breaking changes don't break your code.

If we do introduce a breaking change, we will create new endpoints with a new version prefix in the URI.

# Authentication

## Token-based

Once you have been issued an API key you can use the following code to authorize requests:

```shell
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: Token token=API_KEY"
```

Filmmakers expects the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Token token=API_KEY`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>API_KEY</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

## OAuth

Filmmakers API supports the OAuth flow with refresh tokens.

### Setting up OAuth Access

Once you have been issued an API key with OAuth Authorization enabled, you can use the following configuration from your client code:

[Filmmakers OpenID Configuration](https://www.filmmakers.eu/.well-known/openid-configuration)

See example on how to fetch the OAuth Access Token with curl.

```shell
export CLIENT_ID="your-client-id-goes-here"
export CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret-goes-here"
curl -s -X POST "https://www.filmmakers.eu/oauth/token" \
           -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
           --data-urlencode "grant_type=client_credentials" \
           --data-urlencode "client_id=$CLIENT_ID" \
           --data-urlencode "client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET" \
           --data-urlencode "scope=public"
```

```json
{"access_token":"Uvm37RVcZano399REpMXh837fDT-jtSc0lTvmEexpKI","token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":7200,"scope":"public","created_at":1730119409}
```

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>CLIENT_SECRET</code> with your credentials.
</aside>

### Using OAuth Access Tokens

Filmmakers expects the OAuth Access Token to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`

OAuth access tokens expire after a set period (currently 120 minutes, though this may change in the future) and must be refreshed. Your client software is responsible for automating the OAuth flow. You can always retrieve the expiry time of an access token from the introspection endpoint listed in the [Filmmakers OpenID Configuration](https://www.filmmakers.eu/.well-known/openid-configuration)."


```shell
curl -I https://www.filmmakers.eu/api/v1/actor_profiles -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>ACCESS_TOKEN</code> with a non-expired OAuth Access Token.
</aside>

### Introspecting Tokens

Token information can be retrieved from the introspection_endpoint (see [Filmmakers OpenID Configuration](https://www.filmmakers.eu/.well-known/openid-configuration)
).

```shell
curl -X POST https://www.filmmakers.eu/oauth/introspect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "token=ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -u "CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET"
```

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>CLIENT_SECRET</code> with your credentials and <code>ACCESS_TOKEN</code> with your OAuth Access Token.
</aside>

# Cross origin resource sharing

The API supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for AJAX requests from any origin.

Here's a sample request sent from a browser hitting [https://www.example.com/](https://www.example.com/):

```
$ curl -I https://www.filmmakers.eu/api/v1/actor_profiles -H "Origin: https://www.example.com"
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET
```

# Rate limits

Rate limits are enforced on a per IP address basis. Currently Filmmakers allows up to 300 requests within a 5 minute period. If this quota is exceeded your IP will be throttled for the remainder of this period. In this case the API will return an error responses that shows up as status code `429`.

Along with the status code the following `RateLimit` response header fields will be returned:

```
Ratelimit-Limit: 300
Ratelimit-Remaining: 0
Ratelimit-Reset: 1597048500
```

* `Ratelimit-Limit`: the request-quota associated to your client (defaults to 300)
* `Ratelimit-Reset`: the timestamp when the quota resets

# Pagination

This API supports pagination, following the proposed [RFC-8288](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288) standard for Web linking.

The pagination information is included in response HTTP headers, namely `Total` (total entries), `Per-Page` (entries per page) and `Link` (containing links to corresponding pages).

The current page can be set using the `page` parameter, and the number of entries per page can be specified with the optional `per_page` parameter. The default value for `per_page` is 250, and the maximum allowed value for `per_page` is 1000. If this limit is exceeded, a `400 Bad Request` error code will be returned.

# Webhooks

A webhook is an endpoint on your server that receives requests from Filmmakers, notifying you about events for actor profiles such as a profile edit. This requires a new endpoint on your server such as <https://www.example.com/webhooks/filmmakers> which should be publicly accessible and allow unauthenticated POST requests. Note that HTTPS URLs are required for all webhook endpoints.

**Read the event data**

Filmmakers sends the event data in the request body. Each event is structured as an Event object with a type, timestamp, and related Filmmakers resource nested under data (currently only an actor profile id - see example on the right)

```json
{
  "type": "actor_profile.updated"
  "created": 1633887337,
  "data": {
    "id": 123
  }
}
```

There are currently two event types: `actor_profile.updated` and `actor_profile.deleted`. Note that update events are grouped if they occur within a reasonable timeframe, e.g. you might only receive 1 webhook if an actor profile is updated several times within a short timeframe.

**Return a 200 response**

Send a successful 200 response to Filmmakers as quickly as possible because the event is retried with an exponential back off if a response isn't sent within a reasonable time. This means that you should write any long-running processes as code that can run asynchronously outside the webhook endpoint.

**Verify requests are sent by Filmmakers**

```
X-Signature: t=1492774577, v1=5257a869e7ecebeda32affa62cdca3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff536d0ce8e108d8bd
```

All webhook events are signed by including a signature in each event's header. This allows you to verify that the events were sent by Filmmakers, not by a third party. The Api key is used as secret to sign webhook events. Signatures are generated using a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) with SHA-256.

The `X-Signature` header included in each signed event contains a timestamp and one signature. The timestamp is prefixed by `t=`, and the signature is prefixed by a scheme. Schemes start with `v`, followed by an integer. Currently, the only signature scheme is `v1`.

You can verify the signature on your side as follows (see example on the right in Ruby):

```ruby
# Step 1: Extract the timestamp and signatures from the header
signature = request.headers["X-Signature"]
  .split(",")
  .map { |part| part.split("=") }
  .to_h
# (this returns a hash like { "t" => 1492774577, "v1" => "5257a86..." })

# Step 2: Prepare the signed_payload string
payload = request.body.read
signed_payload = "#{signature['t']}.#{payload}"

# Step 3: Determine the expected signature
expected_signature = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(
  OpenSSL::Digest.new("sha256"),
  "YOUR_FILMMAKERS_API_KEY",
  signed_payload
)

# Step 4: Compare the signatures
expected_signature == signature["v1"]
```

**⚠ Webhooks are not yet generally available. If you are interested in using them please contact our support**


# Error codes

Filmmakers uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter is missing, the request lacks valid authentication credentials, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with our servers (these should rarely happen).

Certain `4xx` errors, notably the `410` Gone status, indicate that a requested resource (such as an actor_profile or a talent_agency) has been merged with another and is no longer available at the original URL. The response will include the ID of the new resource, and clients should use this ID to access the merged resource.

# Actor profiles

## Get all actor profiles

```shell
curl "https://www.filmmakers.eu/api/v1/actor_profiles" \
  -H "Authorization: Token token=API_KEY"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
